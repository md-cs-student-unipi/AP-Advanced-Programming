## TO ORGANIZE

- Given a bean, how can we tell what is its public API?
- Question about complexity of some haskell function. What are the problems between arrays and generics in Java? What happens with generic at runtime/after compilation?
- Is Python more OO or more functional, according to your opinion?
- Explain the concept (with written example) of covariance and contravariance in a language with universal polymorphism and explain in what cases their use is safe
- Explain inversion of control and dependecy injection
- What is lazy evalutaion in haskell and explain the spirit of IO Monads

### Java
- What are streams in java?
- Example of lambdas in a context different from streams
- What are functional interfaces?
- How the java compiler manges lambdas?
- Differences between component, packages and classes
- Talk about the lifecycle of a sw component
- How can we interact with java beans?
- How can Netbeans (or another builder tool) provides "live interaction" with a bean?
- What kind of properties a bean can have?
- Memory management
- How are lambda expressions implemented?
- Talk about streams

### Haskell
- What is "Functor" in haskell?
- What relationships there are between functor and maybe type class?
- Lazyness in haskell

### Python
- What are python decorator?
- How can we write functions with a variable number of arguments
- What is GIL?
- Talk about decorators and higher order functions in general
- Namespaces and scopes
- What does the `@staticmethod` decorator do?

### Other
- Describe the different kind of parameter passing strategies
- What is memoization?
- Differences between `reduce` in functional programming and `collect` in the Java Stream API
- Give an example of list comprehension and write a function using a functional language that does the same thing, using combinators such as `filter`, `foldr`, `map`, ecc...
